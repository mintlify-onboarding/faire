To authenticate calls to the API, pass your Faire API access token as an HTTP request header named "X-FAIRE-ACCESS-TOKEN".

You can test that your Faire API access token is working correctly by running the following command.

```bash 
curl 'https://www.faire.com/external-api/v2/brands/profile' -H 'X-FAIRE-ACCESS-TOKEN: {your access token}'
```

It should return the profile for the brand account the access token is for.

Please always check the HTTP status code returned from any API request. This API will return a status code between 200 and 299 when a request is successful. In any event that the request was not completed, an error code between 400 and 599 will be returned.
