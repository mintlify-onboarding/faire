    A product is a category of similar physical items that are differentiated by their options. An example product could be a Faire-branded sweatshirt. The sweatshirt may come in different sizes and colors. The product itself represents the kind of product, but not a specific variant.

<Card title="Variant Definition" icon="code-compare" iconType="duotone">
  A variant is a specific combination of option values. For example, for a Faire-branded sweatshirt product with "size" and "color" options, a large, red Faire-branded sweatshirt would be a variant. Variants represent an actual physical item and have pricing, unique skus, and inventory.
